                        <p>

                            It is not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work -work with us, not over us; stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it. This Administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy. ~ Ronald Reagan
